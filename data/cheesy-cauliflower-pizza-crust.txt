Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower, broken into florets
1 egg
1/2 cup finely shredded mozzarella cheese
1/2 teaspoon oregano
1 pinch salt


Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). 
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.                            
Place cauliflower florets in a food processor; pulse until chopped into grains the size of rice.                            
Fill a large pot with about 1 inch of water; bring to a boil. Add cauliflower "rice"; cook until softened, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain in a fine sieve and cool until running water.  
                          
Pour cauliflower onto a clean dish towel; roll up and twist edges. Wring out as much water as possible.  
                          
Transfer cauliflower to a large bowl.
Add egg, mozzarella cheese, oregano, and salt; mix well. Spread on the lined baking sheet to about 1/2-inch thickness.                            
Bake in the preheated oven until firm to the touch and light golden brown in color, about 35 minutes.
