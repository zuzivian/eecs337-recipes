Ingredients:
1 pound Italian turkey sausage, casings removed
2 cups chopped onions
2 cups sliced fresh mushrooms
4 cloves garlic, minced
4 cups chicken broth
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 (14.5 ounce) can Italian-seasoned diced tomatoes
1 cup uncooked mafalda pasta
2 cups chopped fresh spinach
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/4 cup Parmesan cheese
4 teaspoons thinly sliced fresh basil

Directions:
Cook and stir sausage in a large pot until browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in onions, mushrooms, and garlic. Pour in chicken broth, tomato sauce, and diced tomatoes; bring soup to a boil.                            
Stir pasta into the soup. Cook, stirring occasionally, until almost tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in spinach, mozzarella cheese, and Parmesan cheese. Remove from heat; stir in basil and let stand until pasta is tender, about 2 minutes more.
