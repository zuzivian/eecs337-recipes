Ingredients:
3 cups chicken broth
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 stalks celery, chopped
1/2 large onion, diced
4 green onions, white and green parts separated and sliced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon curry powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups uncooked white rice
1/2 cup golden raisins

Directions:
Bring chicken broth to boil in a saucepan over medium-high heat; continue simmering while preparing remaining ingredients.                            
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir celery, onion, green onion white portions, garlic, curry powder, and salt in the hot oil until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer vegetables to a bowl.                            
Cook and stir rice in the same skillet until lightly toasted, about 3 minutes.                            
Stir toasted rice into boiling chicken broth. Reduce heat to medium-low; continue simmering until rice is tender and broth is absorbed, about 15 minutes.                            
Remove rice from heat and stir in raisins, green onion tops, and celery mixture until well blended.
