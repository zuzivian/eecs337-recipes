Ingredients:
2 1/4 pounds potatoes, peeled and diced
5 1/4 pounds alligator meat
1 1/2 pounds onions
2 bunches green onions
2 bunches fresh parsley
1 medium head garlic
1/2 bunch celery
1 quart oil for frying
2 eggs
3 tablespoons dried savory
2 ounces salt
1 tablespoon black pepper
2 1/2 pounds cracker meal

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes; drain. Put the alligator meat, onions, green onions, parsley, celery and potatoes through a meat grinder into a large bowl. Mix in the eggs, savory, salt and pepper until well blended. Shape into 1 ounce balls (golf ball sized) and roll in cracker meal.                            
Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Fry meat balls until golden and crisp. Drain on paper towels.
